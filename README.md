TaskFlow is a simple productivity web app built using Vanilla JavaScript, designed to demonstrate core concepts like Closures, Higher-Order Functions, ES6 Modules, DOM Manipulation, and the Event Loop. It features a clean 3-column layout with a sidebar, task list, quick-add form, stats section, and a task detail panel with a built-in Pomodoro timer. Users can add, edit, delete, filter, sort, and search tasks while data is saved in LocalStorage. The project is fully responsive and structured using modular JavaScript for clarity and maintainability.
